Max 1 - Introduction, basic patching. Random note generator
- Ice breaker thing
- Watch a bunch of Youtube videos
- Metro + random
- Storing random to make music (repetition is Music)
- Mouse and keyboard to control your patch (mousestate and key + keyup)
- ASSIGNMENT: Sequence randomness to make a piece

Max 2 - Looking at sounds — harmonic versus inharmonic sounds
- Look at sound recordings (Why do things sound the way they do?)
- Speech, violin, clarinet (maybe)
- AM synthesis, FM synthesis
- Applying an envelope to an oscillator to create a note
- ASSIGNMENT: Short piece using only oscillators, envelopes and mouse+keyboard

Max 3 - Sample playback, curves and automation
- Playing back a sound with playlist~
- Playing a looping sound with playlist~
- Fading playlist~ samples in/out
- ASSIGNMENT: Create a piece that you play by just pressing “go” and then walking away. Use line~ objects to fade samples in and out.

Max 4 - 
- Wavetable synthesis using recorded waveform cycles
- ASSIGNMENT: Use the nodes object to crossfade between waveforms. Control it using the mouse
- Controlling playback of a groove~ object and a play~ object using DSP objects
- Playing forwards, backwards, windowing.
- ASSIGNMENT: Create a piece based around an ostinato that comes from gating one of these effects.

Max 5 - Distortion, frequency shifting, filtering, bitcrushing, waveshaping, organizing a sound processing patch. Send~ and receive~.
- How to do distortion, frequency shifting, filtering, bitcrushing and waveshaping
- How send~ and receive~ work

Max 6 - Reverb + echo, tapin~ tapout~ and convolution. More sound patch organization
- What does delay~ do, and how does it affect the sound spectrum?
- What about tapin~ and tapout~? What do they do?
- Why am I suddenly talking about convolution?
- Now might be a good time to start talking about the FFT. Could also talk about the vocoder here.

Max 7 - Working with MIDI. More patch organization

Max 8 - Polyphony with poly~. MIDTERM part 1

Max 9 - MIDTERM part 2

Max 10 - Working with live audio. Karma~. Feedback and sound textures
- Karma~
- Feedback (different forms of distortion) and sound textures
- Microphone input
- Contact microphones?
- ASSIGNMENT: Short piece using these techniques

Max 11 - Fingerpinger + Wekinator
- How to parse input like from fingerpinger. What makes a mapping good or bad? Wekinator?
- Start/stop, continuous controls
- LEAP motion?

Max 12 Advanced sampling: Polybuffer~, 2d.wave, beat-relative looping.	
- What even is beat-relative?
- Delaying events until the beat
- Calculating swing?

Max 13 - Pattern generation and algorithmic composition

Max 14 - FFT Treatments
Max 15 - Laptop Orchestra

Max 16 - Jitter part 1
Max 17 - Jitter part 2
Max 18 - Max for Live
